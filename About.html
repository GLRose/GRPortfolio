        Thanks for checking out my portfolio website! I hope it can capture my personallity accurately. I enjoy anything outdoors, most notably disc golf, hiking, mountain biking, or even just exploring! I love acoustic guitar and have been playing
        for 17 years. As of recently I have developed a travel bug and find much fulfilment in travelling to new countries.

        Anyway, the point of this website is to showcase some of my skills as a web developer, and love for programming in general! I have had many jobs but in the back of my head I always wanted to be a developer. I have put everything else on hold
        to accomplish this dream. I wont give up and I will continue to learn because thats the best part of this journey.
