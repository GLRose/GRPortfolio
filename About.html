        Thanks for checking out my portfolio website! I hope it can capture my personallity accurately. I enjoy anything outdoors from hiking, mountain biking, or even just exploring. I love acoustic guitar and have been playing for 17 years. As of
        recently I have developed a travel bug and find much fulfilment in travelling to new countries.

        Anyway, the point of this website is to showcase some of my skills as a web developer, and love for programming in general! I have had many jobs but in the back of my head I always wanted to be a developer. I have put everything else on hold
        to accomplish this dream. I wont give up and I will continue to learn because thats the best part of this journey.

        This is my passion. I will be so ecstatic once I finally land my first Jr. Developer position, with a team of other hopefully passionate devs. I am very much a jr. but I am striving to improve every single day (literally). Thanks for sticking
        around!
